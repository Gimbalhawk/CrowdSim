CrowdSim
========

This folder contains a unity project that implements a crowd simulation in arbitrary environments. 

ETLC-Sim.exe is a prebuilt set binaries containing a sample of our simulation in the entryway of ETLC. You can view the scene used to create the binaries if you launch Unity/Assets/ETLC.unity in the Unity editor. It has only been tested with version 4.3.4f1.



Simulation Controls
===================
Movement:   Use wasd keys to move the camera forward, left, back and right respectively
Camera:     Hold down the right mouse button and drag the mouse to turn the camera
Population: Add agents to the scene with the on screen GUI or with the + and * keys. Reduce the population with - and /
Play/Pause: Press space bar to pause or resume the simulation



Creating a new environment
==========================

If you wish to make a new scene, follow these steps:
  -In Unity, File->New Scene
  -Import a model that represents an environment into the scene
  -Move the model such that the flat portion you wish to pathfind on has a y position of 0 (within 0.05)
  -Select the model and in the inspector Add Component->Scripts->Simulation->Setup Environment
  -From the main Assets folder in the Project tab, drag a Character Spawner into your scene. It can be anywhere so long as it exists (it tells the simulation which models it's allowed to use)
  -Place at least one Entrance prefab in the scene
  -Place at least one Exit prefab in the scene
  -Hit play
  
  
  
  Code
  ====
  
  Source code resides in Unity/Assets/Code
  
  The first piece of code called is SetupEnvironment.cs. This initializes the tile grid and Simulation.cs, which runs the simulation.
